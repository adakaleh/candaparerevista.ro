description: "These orange instruments of doom are the Muton of TFTD. Big and tough, but not really the sharpest knife in the alien drawer. Despite this they are very flexible opponents as they can fight with standard weapons or their built-in claw attacks, which can give even the most well protected aquanaut a major pounding. "
