Streamer-ul Ninja face (și mai mulți) bani și aduce profit și pentru Microsoft, site-ul E3 face publice datele personale ale jurnaliștilor, turneul Fortnite aduce multe premii și îmbogățește adolescenții, iar Rockstar reușește să nu plătească impozite pe profit în Marea Britanie în ultimul deceniu. Și săptămână plină pentru jocurile indie românești: s-au lansat **Raiders Of The Lost Island** și **Space Mercs**.
