      <description>Error [RestateIntent]. It was a warning flag he had put in for himself, because he sometimes forgot what he was supposed to be accomplishing mid-code, leaving him with digital chimeras that did something entirely untoward. The system had detected part of the test design going off the rails and wanted him to redefine its goals. He began hunting through the nodes of the limited test environment to find out what had crashed. Error[RestateIntent]. ‘Yes, yes.’ Time to chalk up another failure and get some sleep. User[SenkoviD] Error[RestateIntent]. Just simple building blocks of system communication, the toys he used when he was building the virtual architecture.</description>
